#+TITLE: Introduction
* About
I am a first year PhD student in the Analytics and Optimization group at the Department of Mathematics of VU Amsterdam. My 4-year PhD programme is funded by a public-private initiative between VU Amsterdam, EQUANS, Bluerock Logistics and Fransen Gerrits to optimize supply chain logistics in the animal-feed industry and is supervised by Rob van der Mei (VU/CWI), Sandjai Bhulai (VU) and Joost Berkhout (VU). Our research focuses on the design of scalable and robust algorithms to integrate production and transport planning using traditional optimization techniques (MILP) and large-scale (meta)heuristics (local search, evolutionary algorithms).

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at the Amsterdam University college and I got my Masterâ€™s degree in Operations Research at VU Amsterdam. My [[./thesis.org][Master's thesis]] was on power networks and supervised by [[https://sites.google.com/site/zoccaale/][Alessandro Zocca]].

Outside of academia I spend most of my time cooking, practicing Chinese and tinkering with Emacs.
