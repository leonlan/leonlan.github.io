* Introduction
As a freshly-started PhD Candidate in Operations Research (OR), I have read dozens of academic books and papers to familiarize myself with the state-of-the-art. The academic literature is obviously one of the best places to find this information, but it's not the only place where you can learn about OR.

The OR community is also active in media outlets such as blogs, podcasts and seminars. These outlets have been a valuable source of information to me, and in many cases, I even learn about things that are near impossible to find in the academic literature.
# For example, this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Ykma1eqnY][1-hour seminar]] by Ruben Ruiz on state-of-the-art algorithm in flow shop scheduling was helpful - much easier than reading the [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aTVU3eoAAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao][100+ publications]] on that same topic (there's no survey on this topic). Another example is [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrLq5M3GjRRGYLHBM4Carfg/videos][this interview]] with Thibaut Vidal, in which he talks about the development of the hybrid genetic search algorithm - currently the-state-of-the-art in vehicle routing problems.

So, without further ado, let me present my list of blogs, podcasts and seminars that I think are of interest to other PhD Candidates in OR.
