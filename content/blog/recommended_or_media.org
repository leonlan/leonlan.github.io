* Introduction
As a freshly-started PhD Candidate in Operations Research (OR), I have read dozens of books and papers to familiarize myself with the state-of-the-art. The academic literature is obviously one of the best places to find this information, but it's not the only place where you can learn about state-of-the-art OR. Media such as blogs, podcasts and seminars have also been a valuable resource to enhancing my understanding of OR. These outlets present informal discussions - uncommon in the academic literature - and listening to an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Ykma1eqnY][1-hour talk]] of the inventor of the state-of-the-art algorithm in flow shop scheduling is a lot easier than reading his [[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aTVU3eoAAAAJ&hl=nl&oi=ao][100+ publications]] on that same topic.

Below I present my curated list of blogs, podcasts and seminars that are of interests to PhD Candidates in OR.

* Seminars
# What I like the most about seminars are the Q&A's: asking questions to has helped me to increase my understanding. Below I listed five seminars here that are (1) hosted online and (2) accessible to anyone.
