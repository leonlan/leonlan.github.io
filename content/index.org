Hi, my name is Leon! I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Department of Mathematics of VU Amsterdam. My research interests are include production scheduling, vehicle routing problems and metaheuristics.

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at Amsterdam University College and I got my master’s degree in Operations Research at VU Amsterdam. I wrote my master's thesis about power networks and my supervisor was [[https://alessandrozocca.github.io/][Alessandro Zocca]].

* Current projects
- *Integrating production scheduling and vehicle routing with limited storage* :: My first PhD project. Together with our industry partners, we are investigating a large-scale optimization problem, consisting of a hybrid flexible flow shop, multi-trip vehicle routing problem and limited intermediate storage.
- *[[https://euro-neurips-vrp-2022.challenges.ortec.com/][EURO-NeurIPS 2022]]* :: Competition involving static and dynamic vehicle routing problems with time windows. Our team, OptiML, consists of PhD candidates and professors from VU Amsterdam and the University of Groningen.
- *[[https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS][ALNS]]* :: a full-featured Python implementation of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic. Collaboration with [[https://nielswouda.com/][Niels Wouda]].
- *[[https://github.com/leonlan/CVRPLIB][CVRPLIB]]* :: a Python library to read and download vehicle routing problem instances.
